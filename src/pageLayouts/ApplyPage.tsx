      Your Project Manager will pick one of the following ways to decide the team's project focus:
      </br></br>
      <strong>Focused</strong></br>
      The project starts off with a specific idea or concept from the get-go. These ideas are pitched at the 
      first Tech Start meeting to give you an idea of the types of projects your team will make! Then your team works together to brainstorm adaptations 
      and improvements to the idea, alongside the technologies and platforms to work with!
      </br></br>
      <strong>Open-Ended</strong></br>
      Rather than starting with ideas, projects start in mind with what technologies and platforms they will use, keeping in mind 
      the project manager's previous experiences. Then, based off that, you as a team get to pick 
      a concept, purpose, and scope for the project according to your interests and ideas!`,

      Tech Start projects are themed around startups and entrepreneurship. 
      Our teams use entrepreneurial thinking to guide their decision making and design their 
      project around fulfilling a specific market niche and meeting the needs of a target audience. 
      Despite this theme, Tech Start projects are not about building real startups - instead, 
      we're focused on teaching skills, providing mentorship, and building projects that can boost 
      your portfolio and your career. That said, if you want to pursue your project as a real entrepreneurial 
      venture and monetize it outside of Tech Start, we're able to provide support and direct you to resources 
      that you can use.`,
